      <p>The "whole world needs to be on alert" to fight the coronavirus, the head of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies Programme has said.
        Dr Mike Ryan praised China's response to the deadly outbreak, saying: "The challenge is great but the response has been massive."The WHO will meet on
        Thursday to discuss whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency.The Chinese city of Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak.
        But the virus has spread across China and to at least 16 countries globally, including Thailand, France, the US and Australia.More than 130 people have
        died in China and close to 6,000 have been infected.There is no specific cure or vaccine. A number of people have recovered after treatment, however.

        Coronavirus: How worried should we be?
        The WHO's Dr Ryan said an international team of experts was being assembled to go to China and work with experts there to learn more about how the disease is transmitted.
        "We are at an important juncture in this event. We believe these chains of transmission can still be interrupted," he said.
        Scientists in Australia have managed to recreate the new coronavirus outside of China, raising hope that it could be used to develop an early-diagnosis test.</p>

      <p>WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who visited China this week, said most people who contracted the virus were suffering only "milder symptoms",
         but about 20% had severe effects such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.He said that China "needs the world's solidarity and support," and that "the world is
         pulling together to end the outbreak, building on lessons learned from past outbreaks."The director-general added that the WHO "deeply regrets" referring to the
         worldwide risk from the virus as "moderate" in three reports last week instead of "high".He described the person-to-person spread of the illness in Germany,
         Vietnam and Japan as worrying, and said experts would consider it on Thursday when deciding whether to declare a global emergency.</p>

      <h2>What's happening in Wuhan?</h2>
      <p>The city's residents are enduring an isolated, frightening time. Most forms of traffic have been banned, and 11 million people are shut up in their homes,
        trying to minimise the spread of the virus.Wuhan people cry out 'stay strong' from windows.Videos have emerged online of neighbours shouting "Wuhan jiayou!"
        out of their windows - roughly translated to "Stay strong Wuhan!" or "Keep on going Wuhan".The phrase has been trending on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social
       media site, with people from around the country posting supportive messages."We will get through this. Wuhan jiayou, the whole country is supporting you," read
       one comment on Weibo."This is the first day since the lockdown that I've had to go out," a man in his 50s told the AFP news agency on Wednesday, on a mostly-deserted
       street."I have no choice because I need to buy food."</p>

      <h2>Analysis - Why don't we know the death rate?</h2>
      <p>How deadly is this virus? It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive.It is far too simplistic to take the 130 deaths and the 6,000 cases and come up with
        a death rate of 2%.We're in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated.We don't know if they will live or die, so they can't
        be used in these calculations.We also don't know how many mild and undetected cases are out there."It is very early to make any statements on what the overall
        mortality rate may be," the WHO's Maria Van Kerkhove has warned.Also, the deadliness of the new virus is only one component of its threat.Flu kills hundreds of
        thousands of people each year not because it is super-deadly, but because it is able to infect so many people.</p>
